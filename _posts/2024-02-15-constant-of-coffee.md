In my 10+ years working in industry, I have worked in 18 different offices, four different companies, two different countries. Many things have changed; my work coffee every morning has not.

Thank you, Portfolio Modeling team, DB Risk Berlin, for the coffee press and Star Wars mug that have been a constant through the many years and changes.

### Methodological notes

* The breakdown of different offices per employer are: Deutsche Bank: 1, Allianz Group: 15 (per team, 3, 4, 4, 4), FinTech Startup: 2, Freelance: 1
* Home office rooms are counted once, even if used for different employers, e.g. the FinTech startup and Freelance work is from the same home office.
