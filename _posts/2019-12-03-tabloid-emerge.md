[Matthias Ossadnik](https://mossadnik.github.io) of my team and I had a fun time presenting our artificial-intelligence powered data cleansing tool Tabloid at the Allianz [Global Digital Factory's](https://globaldigitalfactory.allianz.com) annual developer's conference [eMerge](https://globaldigitalfactory.allianz.com/blog/emerge-2019-in-other-s-eyes.html).

I think we were the only data science team presenting in a front-end and DevOps heavy line up, but we also have a respectable front-end and are doing the DevOps that makes sense at this stage in our product development :)
