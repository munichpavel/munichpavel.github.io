title: "Workshop on Risk, Artificial Intelligence and Discrete Geometry"

For the third time I led a two day workshop for the [University of Ljubljana's](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/en/) [Master's program in mathematical finance](http://masters.fmf.uni-lj.si/financial_mathematics.html). This year I focused on artificial intelligence in insurance, and how work of [Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html) on [causality](http://causality.cs.ucla.edu/blog/) makes a difference in how we approach problems like churn and optimizing hit-rates.

The material is available as a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/munichpavel/risk-ai-workshop) under a [GPL 3.0 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), and makes use of my Python package-in-the-making [fake-data-for-learning](https://munichpavel.github.io/fake-data-for-learning/).
