What fantastic energy as I presented the Allianz Insurance challenge to over 300 [Technische Universität München](https://www.tum.de/en/) students for the 2019 [HackaTUM](https://hack.tum.de/) event!

Here is my pitch for the challenge [Benjamin Klepper](https://github.com/bklppr) of my team and I came up with to move insurance from "react and respond" to "predict and prevent" using thousands of historical claim damage images from the [Allianz Center for Technology](https://www.agcs.allianz.com/services/allianz-center-for-technology.html)

Both of our winners had working on-device prototypes in less than 48 hours, and both favored classical computer vision techniques and material physics over deep learning. The winning team shared their solution and code in their GitHub repository [Cracke](https://github.com/aadhithya/cracke).
