*I review tons of CVs in my job and I read "full-stack" here, "full-stack" there. Close to none though covers "my stack". My stack is not only technological, but covers principles, values and strategic intent. Without these it is just worn out buzzwords. Paul is able to stretch to this extent without compromising on the hands-on part.*'

## [Michele Williams, Global Head of Allianz Risk Consulting](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michele-williams-6408784/)

*Paul is a rare combination of data science expertise and business acumen. Paul was a key member of my innovation department at Allianz Insurance, where he built up and led the data science team. He kept his team focused on business value (no easy task in data science), yet also wholeheartedly contributed even when the task was outside of his
team's remit, including an Agile management tool he set up and ran for the whole department. Paul would be a valuable asset to any team or project.*"

## [Sebastian Klepper, CEO of Kognos GmbH](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sklppr/)

*We brought Paul into our business intelligence project to drive the development of data interfaces and analytical models. Paul went beyond handling engineering tasks by proactively taking ownership of stakeholder management, requirements engineering, and acceptance testing. His commitment and holistic approach were essential to delivering the project on time and within budget.*

## About me

My professional ambition is to do useful stuff with mathematics and data. I moved into industry in 2013 after studying physics in the US, then mathematics and history of science at Oxford University on a Rhodes Scholarship, leading to a Dr. rer. nat. (German PhD) and postdoctoral research in mathematics and machine learning in Germany.

Deutsche Bank and Allianz Insurance started me in **risk management**, both quantitative and qualitative, where I had **direct interaction with national regulators**. In 2017 I moved fully to **data science**, first leading customer engagements, then building up and leading data science teams at Allianz Insurance, followed by the same for the accounting startup Translucent. I led small, amazing teams, which meant that I still spent at least 1/3 of my time **building and deploying AI**.

Since 2023 I work as a freelance data scientist and engineer, with customers in **financial services**, **non-profit organizations** and **software companies**.
